			<h2>Premium Oragnic Icecream.</h2>
			<p>Organic ice cream should taste better. What existed in natural food stores were a few brands of ice cream, but none made with the best ingredients, good density, excellent mouth feel and high quality taste. This is where Julie’s brand became the answer for many of our customers.</p>

			<h2>Better for our family, Better for the Enviroment.</h2>
			<p>Organic lifestyles are committed to reducing our intake of pesticides, hormones, genetically modified ingredients, artificial ingredients and sustainable practices for farming that reduce the environmental impact on our earth. So using purer ingredients let’s us create yummy indulgent treats for you to eat. Alden’s or Julie’s Organic is certified “Organic” meaning, greater than 95% percent organic ingredients go into our products, and the other less than 5% are approved per the “National List” approved by USDA.</p>

			<h2>Fresh Fruits Every day.</h2>
			<p>The "natural flavors" when used, listed in the ingredient statements of our Alden's or Julie's Organic products vary per flavor. They are typically concentrated extracts or essential oils from fruits, vegetables and other plant matter. Things like strawberry juice concentrate, coffee concentrate, and peppermint oil are commonly accepted ingredients. Most of our ingredient vendor's formulas are considered proprietary information but we receive Continuing Letters of Guarantee stating there are no hidden allergens or organically unacceptable ingredients.</p>

			<h2>Healthy and Happy Cows give us the best milks.</h2>
			<p>Only the best, of course! Unlike you and I, who can choose to eat from any of the 4 categories of organic (100%, 95%, greater than 70%, and less than 70%), these organic bovine sweethearts are given a strict 100% organic diet which comes from a combination of organic pasture and organic feed.</p>
